# Weather MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes a weather API endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management

## Setup

1. **Start the weather API server** (from the `weather-api` folder):

   ```bash
   cd weather-api
   uv sync
   uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Start the MCP server using VS Code**:

   2.1
   ```bash
   cd weather-mcp
   uv sync
   ```
   2.2  Go to `.vscode/mcp.json` \
   2.3  Edit the location to point it to your `python` binary in your `.venv` generated by `uv`. Also edit the location for `server.py`. \
   2.4  VS Code will show some options to Start/Stop MCP server in the file. Run it from there. \
   2.5  Open Copilot chat and go to Agent mode. \
   2.6  Ask weather for any city. It will use the MCP server to call weather API and return back results.

The MCP server communicates via stdio - connect it to any MCP-compatible client.

## Available Tools

- `get_weather(city: string)` - Get current weather for a specified city
